		<span id="description">Now, this is  a story all about how  My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright. But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</span>
